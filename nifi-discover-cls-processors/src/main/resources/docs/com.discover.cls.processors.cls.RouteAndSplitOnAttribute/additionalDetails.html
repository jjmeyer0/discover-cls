        <h2>Usage Example</h2>
        <p>
            This processor routes a FlowFile based on its flow file attributes by using regular expressions. There are three routing strategies in this processor: Route to Property Name, Route to 'matched'
            if all match, and Route to 'matched' if any matches. For the latter two only have two relationships 'matched' and 'unmatched.' The first, 'Route to Property Name' can have multiple user defined
            relationships. These relationships are determined by the properties the user of this processor creates. This processor can potentially produce multiple flow files. For example, if a user
            defines a custom property that uses a regular expression, for each attribute matched this processor will clone the flow file. If none of the attributes are matched then the flow file will
            be routed to 'unmatched' relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: The goal is to route all files with attributes that end with '_ip' to a 'matched.ip' relationship.
            Add a property with the following name and value:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>property name</strong>: matched.ip
            </li>
            <li><strong>property value</strong>: .*_ip
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this example, all files with attributes that end with '_ip' will follow the 'matched.ip' relationship.
